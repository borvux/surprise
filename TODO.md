# TODO

- make sure the `YES` button does not get way too big and cover up the screen, and make sure that the `NO` button does not go under the `YES` button.
- Make the `YES` button come to a certain size and doesn't grow no more, so it doesn't cover up the `Will you be my valentine message` and make sure to make the `YES` button shake so the user knows it needs to be click `YES` instead of `NO`
- Need some type of hint so the user try and click `NO` button, need something of like speech bubble coming out of the `NO` button saying something like `Don't you dare click NO!` and then the message should change everytime the user click `NO` on mobile or hover near it on desktop. There could be like 6 sets of messages that will pop up inside the speech bubble and it just be on loop. So that will mean when the `NO` button move, the speech bubble should move as well.
